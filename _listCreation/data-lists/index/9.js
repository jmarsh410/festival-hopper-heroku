The fruity-ester aroma is high to very high.  Hop aroma is further characterized by high amounts of citrus with a slightly resinous character in the background.  The aroma follows through to the taste with citrusy characters dancing on the palette, including the presence of fresh oranges.  Thrilla is a medium bodied beer with medium high hop bitterness.  As always, this beer is balanced. We brewed this American IPA specifically for the 2014 Brazil World Cup. Thrilla in Brazilla will be released June 12, 2014, the day of World Cup match 1 between Brazil and Croatia.  The beer will initially feature at pubs agreeing to show a match watching party for the opener.  We will then release the beer to the rest of the market and it will remain available until July 12, the day of the World Cup final. Food pairing?
