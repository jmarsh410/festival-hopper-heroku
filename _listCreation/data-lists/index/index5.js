It is a daughter of Simcoe (YCR 14), one of our favorite hops. Whole cone Mosaic is used for bittering, flavoring, and aroma in the kettle; it is also massively dry hopped. The beer is named after a Texas Heroine.\nTasting notes: chalk-white head with a very clean malt backbone. The hops impart strong grapefruit, pineapple, and blueberry flavor and aroma.

We’ve long seen them growing on the mesquite trees all around us, but up until now, we’ve yet to make beer with them. Perhaps what intrigued us the most is their aroma, which we’d describe as having a brown sugar / molasses character. In this case, we took the beans, hand-crushed them, and added them late in the boil.\n\nThe base beer was quite simple, brewed on September 14, 2016 with malted barley from Blacklands Malt, malted wheat, rolled oats, and Goldings hops. Cerveza de Mezquite was fermented in stainless steel with our mixed culture of brewers yeast, native yeast, and native bacteria.
