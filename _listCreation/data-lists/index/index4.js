It is not barrel aged like its father, Big Bad Baptist; instead its flavor profile was designed to highlight the complex and often unique flavors of small batch coffees. Instead of sourcing a coffee that would play well in a beer we sought out creative and innovative roasters, then asked them which beans they’re passionate about. Each resulting release of Son of a Baptist is widely different depending on the coffee selected. Some are fruity and sweet with notes of jam and chocolate, others are rich and earthy with a big roasted finish. Each limited release is numbered and stamped. The corresponding details and tasting notes can be found on our website. Each release will return to the Roaster’s home market where the beer and the coffee can be sampled side by side.","beer_style":"Stout - Imperial Oatmeal","is_in_production":1,"beer_slug":"epic-brewing-co-utah-colorado-son-of-a-baptist","is_homebrew":0,"created_at":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 19:15:58 +0000","rating_count":15523,"rating_score":4.03504,"stats":{"total_count":19031,"monthly_count":1488,"total_user_count":16974,"user_count":0},"brewery":{"brewery_id":7216,"brewery_name":"Epic Brewing Co.

We blend high quality German malt, fresh hops, and the finest lager yeast to create a beer of extra fine quality & superb drinkability. In the glass the beer is crystal clear, crystal clean and pairs well with 5 more. Light bready malt character blends with a slight noble hop aroma that leads into a delightfully crisp and clean finish.","beer_style":"Lager - American Light","auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false,"has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":17860,"brewery_name":"Hops & Grain Brewing","brewery_slug":"hops-grain-brewing","brewery_label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-HopsGrain_17860.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"hopsandgrain","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hops-and-Grain/190074009287","url":"http://www.hopsandgrain.com/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Austin","brewery_state":"TX","lat":30.2583,"lng":-97.7126},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":4263662,"venue_name":"Buda Elementary School","venue_slug":"buda-elementary-school","primary_category":"Professional & Other Places","parent_category_id":"4d4b7105d754a06375d81259","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_name":"Elementary School","category_id":"4f4533804b9074f6e4fb0105","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"","venue_city":"Buda","venue_state":"TX","venue_country":"United States","lat":30.0843,"lng":-97.845},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":""},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"4c78120a93ef236a1101ab0f","foursquare_url":"http://4sq.com/d0Vo5p"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https://ss3.4sqi.net/img/categories_v2/building/school_bg_64.png","md":"https://ss3.4sqi.net/img/categories_v2/building/school_bg_88.png","lg":"https://ss3.4sqi.net/img/categories_v2/building/school_bg_88.png"},"is_verified":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":2,"count":2,"auth_toast":null,"items":[{"uid":1046751,"user":{"uid":1046751,"user_name":"aagibbs","first_name":"Aaron","last_name":"G.","bio":"All styles of beer are the cut of my jib.","location":"Austin, TX","user_avatar":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/profile/d5e64fdaa901dced0c9a6db2c0d82c04_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","venue_details":[],"brewery_details":[]},"like_id":368650773,"like_owner":false,"created_at":"Wed, 03 May 2017 01:28:35 +0000"},{"uid":1092142,"user":{"uid":1092142,"user_name":"Ryannotbryan","first_name":"Ryannotbryan","last_name":"","bio":"","location":"Austin, Texas","user_avatar":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/profile/0051839626219adcffaa247b58ebbb13_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","venue_details":[],"brewery_details":[]},"like_id":368596136,"like_owner":false,"created_at":"Tue, 02 May 2017 22:49:15 +0000"}]},"media":{"count":0,"items":[]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for iPhone -
