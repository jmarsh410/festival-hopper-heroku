The slight addition of our in-house alder-smoked malt alludes to the distinctive roasted flavor of turn-of-the-century malting practices, without overpowering the more subtle flavors of this dynamic anniversary brew. This limited edition Imperial Stout is brewed with glacier-fed water, birch syrup from Kahiltna Birchworks, wildflower honey, brown sugar and an array of different malts, including malted oats and a dash of our world famous alder-smoked malt.","beer_style":"Stout -
